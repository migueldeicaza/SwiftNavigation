# RecastNavigation for Swift

This is a Swift API binding for the [RecastNavigation](http://recastnav.com) C++ library for 
Swift users.   In addition to providing a binding to Recast navigation, this includes 
[RealityKit systems](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/system) to easily add
crowd control to your entities.

While this comes with [API Documentation](https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/), 
I have not had a chance to put together conceptual docs, which is something I want to do, but 
I am also happy if someone wants to contribute it.

In the meantime, you can check out a very [simple sample here](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigationDemo), 
you will need to adjust paths and other things to get it to work.

# Upstream Version

This code uses Swift's C++ interoperability features to bind to the underlying C++ API.
