# ``SwiftNavigation``

Create and use navigation meshes in your Swift and RealityKit applications. 

SwiftNavigation can turn your 3D models into navigation meshes.  These
navigation meshes are suitable for to find a path between two points in the
mesh, identify valid locations where you content can be placed without
overlapping or crossing other objects.

SwiftNavigation also includes a Crowd manager that can be used to move Agents
(either standalone, or RealityKit entities) towards a specific goal with a 
wide variety of configuration options - and does this while avoiding collisions
with other agents.

SwiftNavigation is a Swift binding to the popular [RecastNavigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) library.

<!-- - <doc:NavMesh> -->
<!-- - <doc:Crowd> -->

You can use the ``NavMesh`` to find valid locations in your navigation
mesh, or to trace a path between two points using a number of
parameters or create agents that will move in your mesh from one point
to another while avoding an overlap with other agents.
